# IndoorLocalization
Code for various versions of localization bots

* This repository will include working or in-progress code to the following portions of this project
  * Line tracing bot version, capable of following a white rope with blue markers on a variety of surfaces, but optimized for non carpeted floor.  This project will become depricated as the project transitions into LIDAR and additional autonomy.
  * LIDAR version.  This will also include sample code and working lidar information processing systems.  Will likely share the same base program with the current working branch.  
  * Any additional extras, such as testing programs
  * Android app responsible for taking measurements and sending to the Pi
